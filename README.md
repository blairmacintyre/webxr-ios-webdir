#  In-Built Home page for custom build of WebXR Viewer

The [WebXR Viewer](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/webxr-ios) allows you to build a web directory into the app, so that you can have demos on your device without relying on the internet.  I added that capability so I can use it for talks at conferences, where the web is often slow or unusable.

Copy this directory to "Web" at the top of the webxr-ios directory.

Currently, the following sites should be copied as subdirectories.
